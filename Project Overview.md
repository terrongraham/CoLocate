# Project Name: CoLocate
## Project Overview
CoLocate is an innovative project aimed at enhancing office collaboration through intelligent calendar event management. It comprises a set of tools and scripts designed to generate, analyze, and recommend collaborative activities within a workplace. The project aims to help individuals and teams make the most of their time by optimizing office interactions and facilitating collaboration.

## Features
### 1. Event Generation Script
**Random Event Generation:** Create random events within arbitrary time blocks for an arbitrary number of people.

**Event Types:** Generate events with types randomly selected from a predefined list (e.g., coding, stand-up, lunch and learn, etc.).

**Collaborative vs. Non-Collaborative:** Distinguish between collaborative and non-collaborative events, with collaborative events having other attendees and non-collaborative events typically having no other attendees. Events can also be tagged as being open to drop-ins and people interested in learning more.

### 2. Office Generation Script
**Random Office Generation:** Create offices of varying sizes that are able to support an arbitrary amount of people. 

### 3. ML-Based Recommendation Script
**Intelligent Event Comparison:** Use machine learning to compare and analyze events to provide recommendations on when to colocate and what office space to use. Additionally provide recommendations on when it would make sense to shift schedules in order to stack colocated events on a single day, so it is used more effectively.

**Recommendations:**
Suggest days suitable for colocating with team members.
Identify opportunities to merge events with other teams.
Offer optimal scheduling for enhanced collaboration.

### 4. User-Friendly Front End
Interactive Interface: Develop a front end that allows users to utilize the event generation and recommendation scripts.
Parameter Adjustment: Enable users to adjust parameters for event generation and analysis, including rate at which meetings occur interteam and percentage of workday occupied by meetings.

## Development Steps
To bring the CoLocate project to life, the following steps will be taken:

### Event Generation Script:

Create a script that generates random events within specified constraints.
Implement event type selection and collaborative/non-collaborative event generation.
Ensure that team dynamics are considered when scheduling collaborative events.

### ML-Based Recommendation Script:

Develop a machine learning model to analyze and compare generated events.
Train the model to make recommendations, including suitable days for colocating and opportunities to join other teams' events.

### User-Friendly Front End:

Design and build an interactive front end for users to access the project's functionalities.
Enable users to adjust event generation parameters and receive recommendations.

### Testing and Validation:

Thoroughly test the scripts and front end to ensure accuracy and usability.
Gather user feedback and make necessary improvements.

### Documentation and Hosting:

Create comprehensive project documentation that explains the project's purpose, features, and usage.
Choose a hosting platform (e.g., GitHub or a personal website) to make the project accessible to others.

## Conclusion
CoLocate is an exciting project that aims to transform office collaboration by optimizing event scheduling and offering intelligent recommendations. We look forward to bringing this innovative tool to life and helping individuals and teams make the most of their time in the workplace.
